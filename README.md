Hello People,

This is the weather app I have built using React and Bootstrap.

Website Live Link: https://weather-app-iqv5.onrender.com

* User can search any city and can see all the weather info for that city.
* User can toggle the temperatute between celcius and fahrenheit.
* User can also see his/her last 5 searches. 
* Handling all the edge cases and validation.
* Displaying appropriate error message for api failure or city not found.

To start the application in local:

1. Clone the repo in your IDE
2. Run command 'npm i' to install the dependencies.
3. Run command 'npm start' to start the application.
4. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser
